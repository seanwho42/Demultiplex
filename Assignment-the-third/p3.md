*5 August 2025*
Started writing python code for part 3 in `demultiplex.py`, starting with local testing.

*6 August 2025*
Continuing development on `demultiplex.py`.

*7 August 2025*
Finished local testing of `deumltiplex.py` successfully. Ran on real data (job id `37054490`).
Some resource usage info:
```
Percent of CPU this job got: 69%
Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 1:05:13
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 248888
```

*8 August 2025*
Realized I had forgotten to fix bug in testing where both forward and reverse reads were being counted towards read counts for hopped and matched reads. Fixed, added some more summary statistics to the output files, and reran on real data (job id `37078376`).
Resource usage info:
```
Percent of CPU this job got: 21%
Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 3:00:04
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 248484
```
For some reason this didn't utilize the CPU as efficiently as the previous run.. it was the same for some others. My best guess is just differences in processors on different nodes being better utilized but I have no idea really.

Submitted the assignment.
